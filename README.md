# Tim's advice
* Have an 80/20 structure:
    * 80% understanble by all audiences.
    * 20% deep for the target audience.
* Have a simplified, easily rememberable version of every important idea.
* Never have a thank you slide. The last slide should be a summary, impact, next steps.
    * Best to have one concrete, compelling steps.
